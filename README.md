## ProCon.IP pool control adapter for ioBroker
ioBroker adapter for basic support of the ProCon.IP pool control unit. It is intended for integration with your voice 
assistant (eg. via the `cloud` adapter for Alexa or `yahka` for Apple HomeKit with Siri).

Further documentation and german translation will follow, when the adapter really implements its major functionality and
therefore becomes some kind of 'production ready'. ðŸ˜‰

## Changelog

### 0.0.1
* initial release with following features:
  * All information from `GetState.csv` as readonly states
  * Writable states for all relays to toggle auto/manual
  * Writable states for relays not configured for dosage control to toggle on/off 

## Development
This adapter is based on the [TypeScript adapter template](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template/tree/master/TypeScript).
